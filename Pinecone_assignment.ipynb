The Group\\'s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable\\nclients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group\\'s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of\\nvarious performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the\\npreparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged\\nGoods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech,\\nenterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services\\noperating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of\\nbusinesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.\\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \\'all other\\nsegments\\' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public\\nservices. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group\\'s offshore software development centers and on-site expenses,\\nwhich are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of\\ntotal expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to\\nprovide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as \"unallocated\" and adjusted against the total\\nincome of the Group.\\nAssets and liabilities used in the Group\\'s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The\\nManagement believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available\\ndata is onerous.\\nDisclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in note 2.16 Revenue from operations.\\nX19AO X18AO \\n37')"
